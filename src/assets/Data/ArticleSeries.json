Coupled with some brilliant casting, this is one Korean drama not to be missed. Set during the Joseon period in 1871, Mr Sunshine begins with a brief glimpse of the past as a Korean boy boards an American warship and grows up in the US as an American.When he returns to his hometown again, it’s as an American soldier causing plenty of inner turmoil and conflict. To spoil much more would be a disservice to this drama.The story is brilliantly paced, even across the extended 24 episode run, and the show backs up its solid writing with some excellent production design and set pieces."

However, this remake does have its own quirks and unique elements.The story revolves around Bong-Hwan, an arrogant chef who finds himself suffering from a head injury which tumbles him back through time. When he awakens, he’s trapped inside the body of the new Queen, So-Yong. With political powers conspiring to thwart her at any moment, Bong-Hwan does his best to play up his role while desperately searching for a way back to the present.Shin Hye-Sun and Kim Jung-Hyun absolutely carry this show, with some absolutely electric scenes when they share the spotlight.

Later, she was brought back to the Silla palace, joining forces with her sister, Princess Chonmyong. Together, they oppose Mi-Shil who wants to seize power for herself.This sets up the crux of drama to follow, as the show begins at the end of King Jinheung’s reign and progresses through until the end of Queen Seondeok’s reign.While there are some historical inaccuracies, this Korean drama is well written and certainly one heck of a rollercoaster ride!"
